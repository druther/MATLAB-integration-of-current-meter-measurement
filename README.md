===============================================

MATLAB functions to integrate current meter measurements for different cross sectional flows

-  `Circular Cross section`
-  `Rectangular Cross section`

This project is under Professor [B.K.Gandhi](http://www.iitr.ac.in/departments/ME/pages/People+Faculty+bkgmefme.html)


Dependencies
============

- `xlrd` - To read data from xls file


Steps to find velocity for rectangular cross section using power law - 

1. Install `xlrd` package using `pip install xlrd`. 
   Windows users need to install pip and python.

2. Run the module named `variation.py` from terminal
   'python variation.py'

3. The results would be in the sample - 
   `Width of channel at this point is 23.04 m`
   `Depth of channel at this point is 0.45 m`
   `Experimental velocity at this point is 1.1483 m/s`
   `Maximum velocity is 1.2473 m/s`
   `Calculated velocity by power law is 1.244316215 m/s`
